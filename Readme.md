## Music Player Application
==================================================
#### ***This project is about a simple music player. I used Qt-designer to build this GUI. This application contains simple music player contents***

### Homepage

This is the main page of the application. At this page you can pick up 3 choises that are 
- All musics
- Singers name
- Playlist

`At first choise(All musics) you can see all the musics that we inserted from a music file.`

#### All songs
When we choose a music and clicked on it twice the music will start. And as we see when we slide the volume, music voice will change. This is also avaliable to change the current time of the song by using horizontal slider.

#### Artists

The second choise will turn to us the name of the artists. When we click on an artist the songs will appear on the list that belongs to that artist.

#### Playlist
The third choise show us the the page of playlists. When we click the plus button, that is on the right, a second window appears.

The second page is for creating a new playlist. There are 2 lists. The left one is full of with all musics and the second one is empty. The method is simple. We click on the songs that we want to add them to our new playlist and we can see them appearing on the empty list. And we give a name to our new playlist and push the button Olustur(Create).

After creating the playlist we can display it on the playlist page.
